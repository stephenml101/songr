# Lab 11 

## May 1st, 2023
- **Completed controller**
  - Use localhost port 8080
  - /capitalize/(type anything you want and it will capitalize)
  - /albums -- port shut down and I was not able to see if the table was showing up. Will ask about it tomorrow. I believe the code is correct to get the html to show up.
- Lab took a total of 4 hours
- Separate css created, will utilize at a future date.
